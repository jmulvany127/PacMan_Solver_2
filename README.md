# PacMan Solver Agent - Project 1 - KU Leuven Year 4

The goal of part 2 of the project was to model the classic Pacman game as both an adversarial and stochastic search problem. To achieve this, the following algorithms were implemented for multi-agent Pacman:

Minimax (with and without alpha-beta pruning)
Expectimax

Additionally, evaluation functions were developed to assess game states. The only file modified was multiAgents.py, while all other code is as provided
